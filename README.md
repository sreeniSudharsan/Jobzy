# Jobzy

This is a project that I did in order to keep track of the jobs that I have accepted and rejected. Almost similar to a task manager, this is an application that has been built 
using Node.Js, MongoDB, Express.Js and React along with a few other libraries such as Axios etc. 


# Deployment 

To build and view the project, download the repository and once you have navigated to the project folder, type in the following command.

    > npm start


You should be able to view it on this link 'https://localhost:5000' :^)
